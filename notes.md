Mini-Exploration-Framework
==========================

What should it do?
------------------

These are the requirements

- Allow plugging together a model, a dataset, a set of training parameters
      and a network metric/visualization to quickly evaluate a metric on many
      models and datasets
- Logging network performance and metrics automatically
- Allow insights into training data (c.f. influence functions)
- Minimal user effort for using it in a pytorch model

Exsting frameworks to evaluate
------------------------------

- [`tensorboard-pytorch`](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboard-pytorch) aka
      `tensorboardX`
